## What is A Bite Of?
It's a series of blogs where I try to explain very little about a topic I have no deep or maybe not even an intermediate understanding of.
For example, I may try to explain about [Markov Chain](a_bite_of_markov_chain.md) which I clearly don't have adequate knowledge of.

## Why am I doing this?
I am currently studying Computer Engineering, so I don't have a lot of time to work on a big project. But I do get some time off occasionally, which is enough for short projects. I want to utilize that time for to actually learn something. I am just getting surface level knowledge on topics while doing this, but it's still something. 

## TLDR
I will write about a topic I don't really know, mostly accompanied by the project I would have done related with it.
