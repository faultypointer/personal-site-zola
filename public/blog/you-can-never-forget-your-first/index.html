I am not kidding, just <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>try it.</a> But it is also very powerful that it is used in machine learning and data science among most other fields.<h2 id=my-first-step-into-programming>My first step into programming</h2><p>I will keep it short. As you read before, Python was my first programming language. I learned it from a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.mikedane.com/>Mike Dane</a> video on <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp>freeCodeCamp</a>'s YouTube channel. It was an excellent video. So I got into python and did some programming problems on leetcode, coding war etc. like websites. My first solid project as a beginner is a GUI quiz application using pyqt. Then I did a very simple Conway's game of life program. After that, I did some of this and that and then came c, c++, a bit of c#, rust, and some others. Maybe I'll write about all that in another post.<h2 id=so-why-am-i-writing-this>So why am I writing this?</h2><p>I haven't done much of python coding for past few months or maybe even a year. But few weeks ago, There was a live coding competition as an event in “Tech Fest” organized by a club in my college which I took part in. I decided to do that in python because why not? After that, all my best times with python began to come into my mind. I also remember how I used 52 elif to make a Caesar cypher.<h2 id=idk-what-to-put-here>IDK what to put here</h2><p>If I keep thinking about what to write more I will just end up abandoning this like most of my project. So I guess this is it for my first blog. Do learn python though, it's really easy.<blockquote class=note id=cc_license><i class="ri-creative-commons-line ri-lg"></i><div class=content><p>This work is licensed under <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>.</div></blockquote></article></main><aside class=blur><nav><ul><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#what-the-hell-am-i-even-taking-about>What the hell am I even taking about?</a><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#a-little-about-python>A little about python</a><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#my-first-step-into-programming>My first step into programming</a><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#so-why-am-i-writing-this>So why am I writing this?</a><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#idk-what-to-put-here>IDK what to put here</a></ul></nav><a aria-label="back to top" href=#top id=back-to-top><i class="ri-arrow-up-s-line ri-2x"></i></a></aside></div><footer><div class=copyright>Copyright © 2022 faultypointer.
